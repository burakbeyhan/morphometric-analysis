# Morphometric Analysis of Vector-based 2D Polygon Features

## About

The PolyMorph-2D plug-in is designed as a free and open-source geographic information system (GIS) toolbox for morphometric analysis of vector-based two dimensional (2D) polygon features in OpenJUMP GIS. The plug-in allows researchers from various earth and spatial science-related disciplines (and also from others) to compute morphometric parameters of 2D input vector features forming a polygon which may represent outer boundaries of various natural and/or man-made entities that differ in size, shape, complexity and drawing scale (e.g., craters, sinkholes, cirques, drainage basins, land parcels, buildings, lakes, ponds, peaks, pits, playas, pockmarks, coral mounds, seamounts, landslides, drumlins, islands, atolls, granular materials, mineral crystals, fossils, etc.). By covering a selected set of the most common morphometric parameters that are used in the earth and spatial science studies, as well as in others, such as biology, mathematics, computer science, etc., the plug-in provides a practical and effective method to quantify object boundary characteristics, which allows analysis of the interrelation of morphometric parameters, leading to an improved understanding of the factors responsible for the formation of the shape. The PolyMorph-2D plug-in is also capable of performing morphometric calculations on overlapping polygon features with or without holes, provided they are topologically correct. Cite as
